The color scheme is very simple and based on the game colors. The main colors used are:
- ![#ADD8E6](<img src="docs/colors/add8e6.png">) `#ADD8E6` - low contrast color
- ![#D3D3D3](<img src="docs/colors/d3d3d3.png">) `#D3D3D3` - background color
- ![#00003C](<img src="docs/colors/00003c.png">) `#00003C` - high contrast color

The pallet used was found on [Coloors.co](https://coolors.co/)
